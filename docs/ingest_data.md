# **IngestData**

The `IngestData` class is a subclass of `BaseOperator` that is used to ingest data from a given URL or file. It supports web scraping functionality and has several methods for ingesting, processing, and validating the data.

## **run_step**
This method takes in two parameters: `step` (a dictionary containing the parameters of the ingesting operation) and `ai_context`. It calls the `ingest` method with the extracted parameters and passed in context to perform the ingesting operation. This is the primary method of this class and acts as an entry point to start ingesting data.

## **ingest**
This method ingests the data based on the provided data URI. It first checks if the data URI is provided; otherwise, it gets the input URL from the AI context. It stores the ingested URL inside the `ai_context.storage` dictionary. If the provided data URI is a valid URL, it scrapes the text content of the webpage using the `scrape_text` method and sets the output as `'uri_content'`. It then adds a log entry stating the content has been scraped.

*Note: In the current implementation, the code is not implemented to handle ingesting files, but it is designed to be extended later.*

## **is_url**
This method checks if the given `data_uri` is a valid URL. In the current implementation, this function always returns `True` as a hacky workaround. This method can be updated to use a proper regular expression to validate the URL format.

## **scrape_text**
This method is responsible for actually scraping the text from the provided URL. It does this using the `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` libraries. The `get` function of `requests` is used to fetch the contents of the URL, and `BeautifulSoup` is employed to parse the downloaded HTML contents.

During parsing, any `script` or `style` tags are removed, and the text content is extracted from the remaining part of the page. The text is then cleaned up by stripping out extra spaces and joining the lines together with newlines. The cleaned-up text is returned as the final output of this method.
