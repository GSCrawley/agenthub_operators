# IndexData

The **IndexData** class is responsible for transforming a given input text into a vector index. The vector index is a dictionary, with keys being embeddings for text chunks and values being the text chunks themselves. The class is derived from the `BaseOperator` and provides a way to split the text into chunks and obtain their embeddings. The main focus of the analysis will be the `run_step` method and the helper functions used in it.

**EMBEDDING_CTX_LENGTH** is set to 1000. This is the size of each chunk of text in terms of tokens, chosen to balance speed and accuracy. `EMBEDDING_ENCODING` is set to 'cl100k_base', which is the encoding used for tokenizing the text.

## run_step

The `run_step` method is the core of the IndexData class. It is responsible for:

1. Cleaning the input `text` by replacing newline characters with spaces.
2. Calling the `len_safe_get_embedding()` function to obtain embeddings for input text chunks.
3. Setting the output `vector_index` with the embeddings dictionary obtained.
4. Adding a log message with the number of chunk embeddings generated.

## clean_text

The `clean_text` function is a simple helper function that removes newline characters from the input text and replaces them with spaces.

## batched

The `batched` function is a generator that takes an iterable object and a batch size, `n`. It splits the iterable into sequential batches of size `n`. It raises a ValueError if `n` is less than 1.

## chunked_tokens

The `chunked_tokens` function is a generator that tokenizes the input `text` given the specified `encoding_name` and `chunk_length`. It splits the tokenized text into sequential chunks of length `chunk_length`. 

## len_safe_get_embedding

The `len_safe_get_embedding` function is responsible for obtaining embeddings for a given input `text`. It has the parameters `max_tokens` and `encoding_name` which default to `EMBEDDING_CTX_LENGTH` and `EMBEDDING_ENCODING` respectively.

The function works as follows:

1. It iterates over the chunks obtained using the `chunked_tokens()` function.
2. For each chunk of text, it calls the `embed_text()` function from the `AiContext` object to obtain the embedding.
3. It converts the numpy array resulting from the embedding to a tuple, which will be the key in the `chunk_embeddings` dictionary.
4. It adds the chunk of text as the value for the corresponding key (embedding) in the `chunk_embeddings` dictionary.

Finally, it returns the `chunk_embeddings` dictionary.
