# BaseOperator

The `BaseOperator` class serves as the foundational class for all operator implementations. This class provides a set of basic functionalities and interface methods that help in building various operators in a pipeline while ensuring consistency and reusability. The class provides both user-visible details like the operator name, as well as more technical aspects like inputs, outputs, and processing steps.

**Important aspects**:
- Unique ID generation
- `run_step` method
- Declaration of name, parameters, inputs, outputs, and secrets
- Optional description

---

## `__init__` method

The **constructor** takes an optional `id` parameter. If an ID is provided, it is used as the operator's ID. If not, a new unique ID is generated using the `shortuuid` library.

```python
def __init__(self, id=None):
    if id:
        self.id = id
    else:
        self.id = str(shortuuid.uuid())
```

## `run_step` method

The `run_step` method is a **placeholder** in the `BaseOperator` class to be overridden by derived operator classes. This is where the core processing logic takes place for each operator based on its specific functionality. The method takes an `ai_context` parameter.

```python
def run_step(self, ai_context):
    pass
```

## `declare_name` method

This static method returns the **user-visible operator name** to be displayed on the frontend. Derived operator classes should override this method with their proper name.

```python
@staticmethod
def declare_name():
    return 'BaseOperator, if you see this it means that derived operator class did not set a proper name.'
```

## `declare_parameters` method

This static method returns a list of **parameters** required for the operator. Users need to set these manually while building a pipeline. The method should be overridden by derived operator classes to declare their specific parameters.

```python
@staticmethod
def declare_parameters():
    return []
```

## `declare_inputs` & `declare_outputs` methods

These static methods return the **input** and **output states** the operator is expected to process. Inputs and outputs serve as the connecting points between different operators in a pipeline. Derived operator classes should override these methods to declare their specific inputs and outputs.

```python
@staticmethod
def declare_inputs():
    return []

@staticmethod
def declare_outputs():
    return []
```

## `declare_secrets` method

This static method returns a list of **secrets** that the operator may use, like API keys or authentication tokens. Derived operator classes should override this method to declare their specific secret requirements.

```python
@staticmethod
def declare_secrets():
    return []
```

## `declare_description` method

This static method returns an **optional plain-English description** explaining the operator's core functionality. Derived operator classes may provide a brief description to improve the user experience.

```python
@staticmethod
def declare_description():
    return ""
```

In summary, the `BaseOperator` class provides a solid foundation for creating various operators in a pipeline system. Derived operator classes should override specific methods to define their unique processing logic, parameters, inputs, outputs, and secrets while maintaining the overall structure and functionalities of the `BaseOperator` class.
