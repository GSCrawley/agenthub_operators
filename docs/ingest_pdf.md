# IngestPDF

The **IngestPDF** class is a part of a larger system and acts as a *BaseOperator*. It is designed to handle the ingestion of PDF files found at a given URL and extract their content. The code leverages various libraries and helper functions to efficiently process the input PDF and store relevant metadata.

## Functions

### run_step

The `run_step` function initiates the PDF ingestion process. It takes in *step* (the current step in the workflow), *ai_context* (an instance of the *AiContext* class), and receives parameters needed for the ingestion process to proceed. This function essentially delegates the task to the `ingest` function, where the actual code execution happens.

### ingest

The `ingest` function is the main entry point for the ingestion process. It works with the *ai_context* object to store, manipulate, and retrieve important data at each step in the ingestion pipeline. If the given *pdf_uri* is a URL, the function proceeds by calling the `load_pdf` helper function, which is responsible for downloading and processing the PDF content.

Upon successful content extraction from the PDF, the `ingest` function sets the output data using the *ai_context*, which can be utilized by other modules in the system.

### is_url

The `is_url` function performs a simple check to determine whether the given *pdf_uri* is a URL. The current implementation always returns *True*, but this could be improved by adding URL validation, if needed.

### load_pdf

The `load_pdf` function takes a URL as input, downloads the file, and extracts its contents. The `requests` library is used to stream the content of the file, and the PDF is temporarily stored in a `tempfile` to allow for reading by the *PyMuPDFLoader* provided by the *langchain.document_loaders* library.

Once the PDF is loaded, the function iterates through the extracted document content and returns it as an array.
