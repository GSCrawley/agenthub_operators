# GmailSender

The `GmailSender` class is a custom operator used for sending emails using Gmail's SMTP server. It has the following important sections:

## run_step

This method gets the necessary parameters and secrets to send an email. The parameters include the recipient's email address and the email body, while the secrets involve the sender's email address and password. It then calls the `send_email` method to send the actual email and sets the output to indicate the email status (whether it was sent successfully or failed).

**How it works:**

1. Get the recipient's email from the parameters
2. Set a default email subject as "AgentHub Run Notification"
3. Get the email body from the input
4. Fetch the sender's email and password from the secrets
5. Call the `send_email` method with the email details and capture the email status
6. Set the output 'email_status' to indicate whether the email was sent successfully or failed

## send_email

This helper function is responsible for sending the actual email using smtplib and MIMEText. It takes the email subject, body, sender, recipients, password, and ai_context as its parameters.

**How it works:**

1. Create an instance of `MIMEText` with the given email body
2. Set the email subject, sender, and recipients
3. Connect to the Gmail SMTP server (smtp.gmail.com) using SSL on port 465
4. Log in to the SMTP server using the sender's email and password
5. Send the email using the `sendmail` method
6. Close the connection to the SMTP server using the `quit` method
7. Add a log entry in the ai_context to indicate the email was sent successfully or an error occurred
