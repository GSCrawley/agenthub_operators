# Summarize

The **Summarize** class is a custom operator in a text processing application that takes input content and generates a summarized output. It achieves this by using the GPT model from OpenAI and creating a "chain" of operations, ultimately utilizing a map-reduce approach to obtain the final summarized response.

## Class Methods

### declare_name()

This method declares the name of the operator as 'Summarize Content'.

### declare_parameters()

This method specifies that the only parameter required for this class is 'temperature' (of type float) which is an optional parameter with a default value of 0.2.

### declare_inputs()

The `declare_inputs()` method declares that this operator needs only one input called 'rts_processed_content' (of type string).

### declare_outputs()

The `declare_outputs()` method specifies that this operator will provide an output named 'summarize_gpt_response' (of type string).

## Main Functions

### run_step()

The `run_step()` function handles the main operation of the Summarize class. It takes in two parameters: `step` and `ai_context`. The function first retrieves the parameters, then calls the `process()` function to obtain the GPT response, and sets the output using the `ai_context.set_output()` method. It also adds the GPT response to a log.

### process()

The `process()` function takes in two parameters: `params` and `ai_context`. It calls the `chain()` function with these parameters and returns the response from the GPT model.

### chain()

This function is responsible for communicating with the GPT model and executing the summarization. It takes in three parameters: `params`, `data`, and `openai_api_key`. The function first initializes a `ChatOpenAI` object with the provided API key and temperature. After that, it loads the summarization chain using the `load_summarize_chain()` function, and runs the chain on the input data. Finally, it returns the summarized response generated by the GPT model.


By following this pipeline, the Summarize class provides an easy way to get summarized content from a given input while utilizing the advanced capabilities of OpenAI's GPT model.
