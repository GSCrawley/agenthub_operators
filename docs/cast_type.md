# CastType

The `CastType` class is a subclass of `BaseOperator`. It serves as an operator for casting the type of the input into the desired output type as specified. The `BaseOperator` class has the basic structure and implementation, and `CastType` class extends it to provide the conversion capability.

## declare_name

This static method returns the name of the operator which is `'Cast Type'`.

## declare_parameters

This static method defines the parameters used by the operator. The only parameter is `output_type` which is a string indicating the type to cast the input to.

## declare_inputs

This static method declares the type of input that the operator can process. In this case, the input can be of any data type.

## declare_outputs

This static method declares the output type of the operator. Here, the output can also be of any data type.

## run_step

This method is the core of the `CastType` class. It is responsible for performing the conversion operation according to the input and the specified output_type. The implementation of this method is as follows:

1. Retrieve the input value and type from the `ai_context`.

2. Get the desired `output_type` from the step parameters.

3. Check the input type and required output type, and perform the conversion accordingly.

    - If the input type is a list of documents (`"Document[]"`) and the desired output type is 'string', it joins the content of each document in the list into a single string and sets this as the output.

4. If the conversion was successful, return `True`. If not, log the failure using `log_cannot_cast` method and return `False`.

## log_cannot_cast

This is a helper method for logging a failure message when the `CastType` operator cannot perform the conversion. It takes the input type `it`, desired output type `ot`, and `ai_context` as arguments and adds a log entry with a message detailing that the conversion from `it` to `ot` is not supported.

In summary, the `CastType` class is an operator that allows for simple conversion of input data to a specified output type, based on the input and output type declarations. The main functionality is implemented in the `run_step` method, which handles the conversion and sets the output result.
