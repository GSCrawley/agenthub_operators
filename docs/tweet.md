# Tweet
This Python class provides functionality to send tweets on Twitter using the Tweepy library. The **Tweet** class is a custom operator that gets the necessary credentials, composes the tweet, and sends the tweet.  The following sections provide an in-depth explanation of the important components of the code.

### Set Twitter Keys and Secrets
```python
def set_twitter_keys_and_secrets(self, ai_context):
```
This function sets the necessary keys and secrets to authenticate the client with the Twitter API. The keys and secrets are stored as secrets in the context, and this function reads and assigns them to their respective class variables.

### Run Step
```python
def run_step(
    self,
    step,
    ai_context: AiContext
):
```
The `run_step` function is the main function called by the workflow. It receives the input `tweet_text` and the previously stored URL to be shared in the tweet. It then sets the Twitter keys and secrets and sends the tweet using the `send_tweet` function. Finally, it sets the output value for the `tweet_status` and adds the tweeted URL to the memory list.

### Trim Trailing Hashtags
```python
def trim_trailing_hashtags(self, text, url):
```
This helper function trims trailing hashtags from the given `text` so that the total length of the tweet, including the `url`, is within the allowed 280 characters. 

### Send Tweet
```python
def send_tweet(self, tweet_text, url, ai_context):
```
This function is responsible for sending the tweet. It initializes the Tweepy client with the Twitter API keys and secrets. If the tweet text is too long, the `trim_trailing_hashtags` function is called to remove excessive hashtags. The `url` is then appended to the tweet text, and the final tweet is logged.

The function attempts to send the tweet and returns the output depending on the success or failure of the tweet. If successful, it returns a URL to the live tweet; otherwise, it returns an error message describing the reason for the failure.
