# GitHubDocsWriter

The **GitHubDocsWriter** class is responsible for creating and updating a GitHub repository's documentation based on provided code content. This class extends the *BaseOperator* class and focuses on the `run_step` function, where the main workflow is implemented, as well as a helper function `create_branch_with_backoff`.

## run_step

The `run_step` function performs the following steps:

1. Retrieve the necessary parameters, inputs, and secrets, such as `repo_name`, `docs_folder_name`, and the GitHub access token.
2. Connect to the GitHub API and obtain references to the original repository and the forked repository.
3. Create a new branch in the forked repository, named with the format "agent_hub_\<run_id\>".
4. Iterate through the provided code content and create or update the documentation files in markdown format within the specified `docs_folder_name`.
5. Create a pull request to merge the changes from the forked repository back into the original repository.

### Creating and Updating Documentation Files

For each code content element provided, the function extracts the file path and converts the file extension to `.md` for markdown files. It then generates a commit message containing the file path and a reference to the AgentHub run URL, making it easy to trace the origin of the changes.

If the documentation file already exists in the original repository, it updates the file in the forked repository with new content provided. Otherwise, it creates a new file in the forked repository.

## create_branch_with_backoff

This is a helper function that attempts to create a new branch in the forked repository with a specified name and base branch commit SHA. It uses an exponential backoff strategy in case of errors, up to a maximum number of retries. The initial delay and backoff factor can be configured.

The function is called within the `run_step` function to create the new branch for adding or updating the documentation files.

## Summary

In summary, the **GitHubDocsWriter** class is a powerful tool for automating the creation and updating of GitHub documentation based on provided code content. By extending the `BaseOperator` class and utilizing the GitHub API, it simplifies the workflow and reduces the need for manual intervention, making it easier to keep your documentation up-to-date and in sync with your codebase.
