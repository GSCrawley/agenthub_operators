# About

This repository contains all public AgentHub operators [agenthub.dev](https://agenthub.dev). AgentHub as a platform hosts and runs your AI pipelines that are built with these open source operators. 

# What is an Operator

Each AI powered pipeline on AgentHub is made up of modular components called operators. An operator is a small building block that performs an explicit action (Ex: GmailReader reads emails, AskChatGPT queries the openAI api, Tweet send a tweet).

Each operator is a short python script wrapped in the same rigid structure that definines inputs, parameters, outputs and the "run_step". The run_step contains the logic of each operator. 

If AgentHub is ever missing an operator you need it's only a few lines of python away from existing. Message in the discord for help creating it or raise a PR to add your own custom operator. 

## Documentation

All operators in this repository are thoroughly documented in the `/docs` folder. What makes our documentation truly unique is that it is completely generated using GPT-4 via an AgentHub automation. We run this automation regularly ensuring it is always up-to-date and in sync with the current state of the project.

To access the operator documentation, navigate to the `/docs` directory, or you can view it online [here](https://github.com/agenthubdev/agenthub_operators/tree/main/docs).
